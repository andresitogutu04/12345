What's new?
===========

This page gives some of the key improvements in each galpy
version. See the ``HISTORY.txt`` file in the galpy source for full
details on what is new and different in each version.

v1.7
+++++

Version 1.7 adds many new features, mainly in the ``galpy.potential`` and
``galpy.df`` modules. The biggest new additions are:

* A general framework for spherical distribution functions defined
  using :math:`f(E,L)` models. Specifically, general solutions for (a)
  isotropic :math:`f(E)` models, (b) :math:`f(E,L)` models with
  constant anisotropy :math:`\beta`, and (c) :math:`f(E,L)` models
  with Osipkov-Merritt-type anisotropy are implemented for any
  potential/density pair (not necessarily self-consistent). These
  distribution functions can be evaluated, sampled exactly, and any
  moment of the distribution function can be calculated. Documentation
  of this is currently available at
  :ref:`api_sphericaldfs`. Distribution functions with constant
  anisotropy require the `JAX <https://github.com/google/jax>`__.

* In addition to the general solution, the distribution function of a
  few well-known distribution functions was added, including (a)
  Hernquist distribution functions that are isotropic, have constant
  anisotropy, or have Osipkov-Merritt type anisotropy; (b) an
  isotropic Plummer profile; (c) the isotropic NFW profile (either
  using the approx. from Widrow 2000 or using an improved
  approximation) and the Osipkov-Merritt NFW profile (new approximate
  form); (d) the King model (also added as a potential as
  KingPotential).

Other new additions include:

* New or improved potentials and :ref:`potential wrappers
  <potwrappers>`:

  * :ref:`interpSphericalPotential <interpsphere>`: general
    class to build interpolated versions of spherical potentials.

  * :ref:`AdiabaticContractionWrapperPotential
    <api_potwrap_adiabaticcontract>`: wrapper potential to
    adiabatically contract a spherical dark-matter halo in response to
    the adiabatic growth of a baryonic component.

  * :ref:`TriaxialGaussianPotential <api_pot_triaxgauss>`: potential
    of a Gaussian stratified on triaxial ellipsoids (`Emsellem et
    al. 1994
    <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994A%26A...285..723E/abstract>`__).

  * :ref:`PowerTriaxialPotential <api_pot_triaxpower>`: potential of a
    triaxial power-law density (like ``PowerSphericalPotential``, but
    triaxial).

  * :ref:`AnyAxisymmetricRazorThinDiskPotential
    <api_pot_arbitraryrazorthin>`: potential of an arbitrary
    razor-thin axisymmetric disk (not in C, mainly useful for
    rotation-curve modeling).

  * :ref:`AnySphericalPotential <api_pot_arbitraryspherical>`:
    potential of an arbitrary spherical density distribution (not in
    C, mainly useful for rotation-curve modeling).

  * :ref:`RotateAndTiltWrapperPotential <api_potwrap_rotatetilt>`:
    wrapper potential to re-orient a potential arbitrarily in three
    dimensions.

* Other changes to Potential classes, methods, and functions:

  * Functions to compute the SCF density/potential expansion
    coefficients based on an N-body representation of the density
    (:ref:`scf_compute_coeffs_spherical_nbody
    <scf_compute_coeffs_sphere_nbody>`,
    :ref:`scf_compute_coeffs_axi_nbody
    <scf_compute_coeffs_axi_nbody>`, and
    :ref:`scf_compute_coeffs_nbody <scf_compute_coeffs_nbody>`).

  * An :ref:`NFWPotential <api_pot_nfw>` can now be initialized using
    ``rmax/vmax``, the radius and value of the maximum circular
    velocity.

  * Potential functions and methods to compute the zero-velocity
    curve: ``zvc`` and ``zvc_range``. The latter computes the range in
    R over which the zero-velocity curve is defined, the former gives
    the positive z position on the zero-velocity curve for a given
    radius in this range.

  * ``rhalf`` Potential function/method for computing the half-mass
    radius.

  * ``tdyn`` Potential function/method for computing the dynamical time
    using the average density.

  * ``Potential.mass`` now always returns the mass within a spherical
    shell if only one argument is given. Implemented faster versions
    of many mass implementations using Gauss' theorem (including
    :ref:`SCFPotential <scf_potential>` and :ref:`DiskSCFPotential
    <disk_scf_potential>`).

  * Mixed azimuthal,vertical 2nd derivatives for all non-axisymmetric
    potentials in function ``evaluatephizderivs`` and method
    ``phizderiv``. Now all second derivatives in cylindrical coordinates
    are implemented.

  * Function/method ``plotSurfaceDensities/plotSurfaceDensity`` for
    plotting, you'll never guess, the surface density of a potential.

  * Re-implementation of ``DoubleExponentialDiskPotential`` using the
    double-exponential formula for integrating Bessel functions,
    resulting in a simpler, more accurate, and more stable
    implementation. This potential is now accurate to ~machine
    precision.

  * Potentials are now as much as possible numerically stable at ``r=0``
    and ``r=inf``, meaning that they can be evaluated there.

Other additions and changes include:

  * Added the inverse action-angle transformations for the isochrone
    potential (in :ref:`actionAngleIsochroneInverse
    <api_aa_isochroneinv>`) and for the one-dimensional harmonic
    oscillator (in :ref:`actionAngleHarmonicInverse
    <api_aa_harminv>`). Also added the action-angle calculation for
    the harmonic oscilator in :ref:`actionAngleHarmonic
    <api_aa_harm>`. Why yes, I have been playing around with the
    TorusMapper a bit!

  * Renamed ``galpy.util.bovy_coords`` to ``galpy.util.coords``,
    ``galpy.util.bovy_conversion`` to ``galpy.util.conversion``, and
    ``galpy.util.bovy_plot`` to ``galpy.util.plot`` (but old ``from
    galpy.util import bovy_X`` will keep working for now). Also
    renamed some other internal utility modules in the same way
    (``bovy_symplecticode``, ``bovy_quadpack``, and ``bovy_ars``;
    these are not kept backwards-compatible). Trying to make the code
    a bit less egotistical!

  * Support for Python 3.9.

v1.6
+++++

This version mainly consists of changes to the internal functioning of
``galpy``; some of the new outward-facing features are:

* `ChandrasekharDynamicalFrictionForce
  <reference/potentialchandrasekhardynfric.html>`__ is now implemented
  in C, leading to 100x to 1000x speed-ups for orbit integrations
  using dynamical friction compared to the prior pure-Python version.

* New potentials:

  * `HomogeneousSpherePotential   <reference/potentialhomogsphere.html>`__: the potential of a constant density sphere out to some radius R.

  * `DehnenSphericalPotential <reference/potentialdehnen.html>`__: the
    Dehnen Spherical Potential from `Dehnen (1993)
    <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993MNRAS.265..250D>`__.

  * `DehnenCoreSphericalPotential
    <reference/potentialcoredehnen.html>`__: the Dehnen Spherical
    Potential from `(Dehnen 1993)
    <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993MNRAS.265..250D>`__ with alpha=0
    (corresponding to an inner core).

* Some notable internal changes:

  * Fixed a bug in how ``DiskSCFPotential`` instances are passed to C
    for orbit integration that in particular affected the
    ``McMillan17`` Milky-Way potential (any hole in the surface
    density was effectively ignored in the C code in v1.5).

  * The performance of orbit animations is significantly improved.

  * All main galpy C extensions are now compiled into a single
    shared-object library ``libgalpy``.

  * Binary wheels are now automatically built for Windows, Mac, and
    most major Linux distributions upon every push to the ``master`` 
    (now ``main``) branch and these are automatically uploaded to PyPI 
    upon release. See the :ref:`Installation Instructions <installation>`
    for more info. Binary wheels on Windows are also built for every
    push on AppVeyor, see the :ref:`Windows installation instructions
    <install_win>`.

v1.5
+++++

This version will be the last to support Python 2.7 as this version of Python is `reaching end-of-life on January 1 2020 <https://python3statement.org/>`__.

* This version's highlight is a fully re-written implementation of
  ``galpy.orbit.Orbit`` such that it can now contain and manipulate
  multiple objects at once. ``galpy.orbit.Orbit`` can be initialized
  with an arbitrary shape of input objects in a :ref:`variety of ways
  <orbmultinit>`, manipulated in a manner similar to Numpy arrays, and
  all ``Orbit`` methods work efficiently on ``Orbit`` instances
  containing multiple objects. Some methods, such as :ref:`orbit
  integration <orbintegration>` and those for :ref:`fast orbital
  characterization <fastchar>` are parallelized on multi-core
  machines. ``Orbit`` instances can contain and manipulate millions of
  objects simultaneously now.

* Added the ``galpy.potentials.mwpotentials`` module with various
  Milky-Way-like potentials. Currently included are MWPotential2014,
  McMillan17 for the potential from McMillan (2017), models 1 through
  4 from Dehnen & Binney (1998), and the three models from Irrgang et
  al. (2013). See :ref:`this section of the API documentation
  <potential-mw>` for details.

* Added a (JSON) list with the phase-space coordinates of known
  objects (mainly Milky Way globular clusters and dwarf galaxies) for
  easy :ref:`Orbit.from_name initialization <orbfromname>`. For
  ease of use, Orbit.from_name also supports tab completion for known
  objects in this list in IPython/Jupyter.

* Added ``galpy.potential.to_amuse`` to create an `AMUSE
  <http://www.amusecode.org>`__ representation of any galpy potential,
  :ref:`allowing galpy potentials to be used as external gravitational
  fields in AMUSE N-body simulations <amusepot>`.

* New or improved potentials and :ref:`potential wrappers <potwrappers>`:

  * `MovingObjectPotential <reference/potentialmovingobj.html>`__: Re-wrote ``potential.MovingObjectPotential`` to allow general mass distributions for the moving object, implemented now as standard galpy potentials. Also added a C implementation of this potential for fast orbit integration.

  * `IsothermalDiskPotential <reference/potentialisodisk.html>`__: The one-dimensional potential of an isothermal self-gravitating disk (sech^2 profile).

  * `NumericalPotentialDerivativesMixin <reference/potentialnumericalpotentialderivsmixin.html>`__: a Mixin class to add numerically-computed forces and second derivatives to any Potential class, allowing new potentials to be implmented quickly by only implementing the potential itself and obtaining all forces and second derivatives numerically.

  * `DehnenSmoothWrapperPotential <reference/potentialdehnensmoothwrapper.html>`__: Can now decay rather than grow a potential by setting ``decay=True``.

  * Added support to combine Potential instances or lists thereof through the addition operator. E.g., ``pot= pot1+pot2+pot3`` to create the combined potential of the three component potentials (pot1,pot2,pot3). Each of these components can be a combined potential itself. As before, combined potentials are simply lists of potentials, so this is simply an alternative (and perhaps more intuitive) way to create these lists.

  * Added support to adjust the amplitude of a Potential instance through multiplication of the instance by a number or through division by a numer. E.g., ``pot= 2.*pot1`` returns a Potential instance that is the same as pot1, except that the amplitude is twice larger. Similarly, ``pot= pot1/2.`` decreases the amplitude by a factor of two. This is useful, for example, to quickly change the mass of a potential. Only works for Potential instances, not for lists of Potential instances.

* New or improved ``galpy.orbit.Orbit`` functionality and methods:

  * Added support for 1D orbit integration in C.

  * Added support to plot arbitrary combinations of the basic Orbit attributes by giving them as an expresion (e.g., ``orb.plot(d2='vR*R/r+vz*z/r')``); requires the `numexpr <https://github.com/pydata/numexpr>`__ package.

  * Switched default Sun's vertical height zo parameter for Orbit initialization to be the value of 20.8 pc from `Bennett & Bovy (2019) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.482.1417B>`__.

  * Add Python and C implementation of Dormand-Prince 8(5,3) integrator.

v1.4
+++++

* Added dynamical friction as the `ChandrasekharDynamicalFrictionForce
  <reference/potentialchandrasekhardynfric.html>`__ class, an
  implementation of dynamical friction based on the classical
  Chandrasekhar formula (with recent tweaks from the literature to
  better represent the results from N-body simulations).

* A general ``EllipsoidalPotential`` superclass for implementing
  potentials with densities that are constant on ellipsoids (functions
  of :math:`m^2 = x^2 + y^2/b^2 + z^2/c^2`). Also implemented in
  C. Implementing new types of ellipsoidal potentials now only
  requires three simple functions to be defined: the density as a
  function of m, its derivative with respect to m, and its integral
  with respect to m^2. Makes implementing any ellipsoidal potential a
  breeze. See examples in the new-potentials section below.

* New or improved potentials and :ref:`potential wrappers <potwrappers>`:

  * `CorotatingRotationWrapperPotential <reference/potentialcorotwrapper.html>`__: wrapper to make a pattern (e.g., a `SpiralArmsPotential <reference/potentialspiralarms.html>`__) wind up over time such that it is always corotating (see `Hunt et al. (2018) <http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02832>`_ for an example of this).

  * `GaussianAmplitudeWrapperPotential <reference/potentialgaussampwrapper.html>`__: wrapper to modulate the amplitude of a (list of) ``Potential`` (s) with a Gaussian.

  * `PerfectEllipsoidPotential <reference/potentialperfectellipsoid.html>`__: Potential of a perfect triaxial ellipsoid (`de Zeeuw 1985 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985MNRAS.216..273D>`__).

  * `SphericalShellPotential <reference/potentialsphericalshell.html>`__: Potential of a thin, spherical shell.

  * `RingPotential <reference/potentialring.html>`__: Potential of a circular ring.

  * Re-implemented ``TwoPowerTriaxialPotential``, ``TriaxialHernquistPotential``, ``TriaxialJaffePotential``, and ``TriaxialNFWPotential`` using the general ``EllipsoidalPotential`` class.

* New ``Potential`` methods and functions:

  * Use nested lists of ``Potential`` instances wherever lists of ``Potential`` instances can be used. Allows easy adding of components (e.g., a bar) to previously defined potentials (which may be lists themselves): new_pot= [pot,bar_pot].
  * `rtide <reference/potentialrtides.html>`__ and `ttensor <reference/potentialttensors.html>`__: compute the tidal radius of an object and the full tidal tensor.
  * `surfdens <reference/potentialsurfdens.html>`__ method and `evaluateSurfaceDensities <reference/potentialsurfdensities.html>`__ function to evaluate the surface density up to a given z.
  * `r2deriv <reference/potentialsphr2deriv.html>`__ and `evaluater2derivs <reference/potentialsphr2derivs.html>`__: 2nd derivative wrt spherical radius.
  * `evaluatephi2derivs <reference/potentialphi2derivs.html>`__: second derivative wrt phi.
  * `evaluateRphiderivs <reference/potentialrphiderivs.html>`__: mixed (R,phi) derivative.

* New or improved ``galpy.orbit.Orbit`` functionality and methods:

  * `Orbit.from_name <reference/orbitfromname.html>`__ to initialize an ``Orbit`` instance from an object's name. E.g., ``orb= Orbit.from_name('LMC')``.
  * Orbit initialization without arguments is now the orbit of the Sun.
  * Orbits can be initialized with a `SkyCoord <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord.html>`__.
  * Default ``solarmotion=`` parameter is now 'schoenrich' for the Solar motion of `Schoenrich et al. (2010) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.403.1829S>`__.
  * `rguiding <reference/orbitrguiding.html>`__: Guiding-center radius.
  * `Lz <reference/orbitlz.html>`__: vertical component of the angular momentum.
  * If astropy version > 3, `Orbit.SkyCoord <reference/orbitskycoord.html>`__ method returns a SkyCoord object that includes the velocity information and the Galactocentric frame used by the Orbit instance.

* ``galpy.df.jeans`` module with tools for Jeans modeling. Currently only contains the functions `sigmar <reference/dfjeanssigmar.html>`__ and `sigmalos <reference/dfjeanssigmalos.html>`__ to calculate the velocity dispersion in the radial or line-of-sight direction using the spherical Jeans equation in a given potential, density profile, and anisotropy profile (anisotropy can be radially varying).

* Support for compilation on Windows with MSVC.

v1.3
+++++

* A fast and precise method for approximating an orbit's eccentricity,
  peri- and apocenter radii, and maximum height above the midplane
  using the Staeckel approximation (see `Mackereth & Bovy 2018
  <https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02592>`__). Can determine
  these parameters to better than a few percent accuracy in as little
  as 10 :math:`\mu\mathrm{s}` per object, more than 1,000 times faster
  than through direct orbit integration. See :ref:`this section
  <fastchar>` of the documentation for more info.

* A general method for modifying ``Potential`` classes through
  potential wrappers---simple classes that wrap existing potentials to modify
  their behavior. See :ref:`this section <potwrappers>` of the
  documentation for examples and :ref:`this section <addwrappot>` for
  information on how to easily define new wrappers. Example wrappers
  include `SolidBodyRotationWrapperPotential
  <reference/potentialsolidbodyrotationwrapper.html>`__ to allow *any*
  potential to rotate as a solid body and
  `DehnenSmoothWrapperPotential
  <reference/potentialsolidbodyrotationwrapper.html>`__ to smoothly
  grow *any* potential. See :ref:`this section of the galpy.potential
  API page <potwrapperapi>` for an up-to-date list of wrappers.

* New or improved potentials:

  * `DiskSCFPotential <reference/potentialdiskscf.html>`__: a general Poisson solver well suited for galactic disks
  * Bar potentials `SoftenedNeedleBarPotential <reference/potentialsoftenedneedle.html>`__ and `FerrersPotential <reference/potentialferrers.html>`__ (latter only in Python for now)
  * 3D spiral arms model `SpiralArmsPotential <reference/potentialspiralarms.html>`__
  * Henon & Heiles (1964) potential `HenonHeilesPotential <reference/potentialhenonheiles.html>`__
  * Triaxial version of `LogarithmicHaloPotential <reference/potentialloghalo.html>`__
  * 3D version of `DehnenBarPotential <reference/potentialdehnenbar.html>`__
  * Generalized version of `CosmphiDiskPotential <reference/potentialcosmphidisk.html>`__

* New or improved ``galpy.orbit.Orbit`` methods:

  * Method to display an animation of an integrated orbit in jupyter notebooks: `Orbit.animate <reference/orbitanimate.html>`__. See :ref:`this section <orbanim>` of the documentation.
  * Improved default method for fast calculation of eccentricity, zmax, rperi, rap, actions, frequencies, and angles by switching to the Staeckel approximation with automatically-estimated approximation parameters.
  * Improved plotting functions: plotting of spherical radius and of arbitrary user-supplied functions of time in Orbit.plot, Orbit.plot3d, and Orbit.animate.

* ``actionAngleStaeckel`` upgrades:

  * ``actionAngleStaeckel`` methods now allow for different focal lengths delta for different phase-space points and for the order of the Gauss-Legendre integration to be specified (default: 10, which is good enough when using actionAngleStaeckel to compute approximate actions etc. for an axisymmetric potential). 
  * Added an option to the estimateDeltaStaeckel function to facilitate the return of an estimated delta parameter at every phase space point passed, rather than returning a median of the estimate at each point. 

* `galpy.df.schwarzschilddf <reference/dfschwarzschild.html>`__:the simple Schwarzschild distribution function for a razor-thin disk (useful for teaching).


v1.2
+++++

* Full support for providing inputs to all initializations, methods,
  and functions as `astropy Quantity
  <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.units.Quantity.html>`__
  with `units <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/>`__ and for
  providing outputs as astropy Quantities.

* ``galpy.potential.TwoPowerTriaxialPotential``, a set of triaxial
  potentials with iso-density contours that are arbitrary, similar,
  coaxial ellipsoids whose 'radial' density is a (different) power-law
  at small and large radii: 1/m^alpha/(1+m)^beta-alpha (the triaxial
  generalization of TwoPowerSphericalPotential, with flattening in the
  density rather than in the potential; includes triaxial Hernquist
  and NFW potentials.

* ``galpy.potential.SCFPotential``, a class that implements general
  density/potential pairs through the basis expansion approach to
  solving the Poisson equation of Hernquist & Ostriker (1992).  Also
  implemented functions to compute the coefficients for a given
  density function. See more explanation :ref:`here
  <scf_potential_docs>`.

* ``galpy.actionAngle.actionAngleTorus``: an experimental interface to
  Binney & McMillan's TorusMapper code for computing positions and
  velocities for given actions and angles. See the installation
  instructions for how to properly install this. See :ref:`this
  section <aatorus>` and the ``galpy.actionAngle`` API page for
  documentation.

* ``galpy.actionAngle.actionAngleIsochroneApprox`` (Bovy 2014) now
  implemented for the general case of a time-independent potential.

* ``galpy.df.streamgapdf``, a module for modeling the effect of a
  dark-matter subhalo on a tidal stream. See `Sanders et al. (2016)
  <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.457.3817S>`__. Also
  includes the fast methods for computing the density along the stream
  and the stream track for a perturbed stream from `Bovy et al. (2016)
  <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1606.03470>`__.

* ``Orbit.flip`` can now flip the velocities of an orbit in-place by
  specifying ``inplace=True``. This allows correct velocities to be
  easily obtained for backwards-integrated orbits.

* ``galpy.potential.PseudoIsothermalPotential``, a standard
  pseudo-isothermal-sphere
  potential. ``galpy.potential.KuzminDiskPotential``, a razor-thin
  disk potential.

* Internal transformations between equatorial and Galactic coordinates
  are now performed by default using astropy's `coordinates
  <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/index.html>`__
  module. Transformation of (ra,dec) to Galactic coordinates for
  general epochs.

v1.1
+++++

* Full support for Python 3.

* ``galpy.potential.SnapshotRZPotential``, a potential class that can
  be used to get a frozen snapshot of the potential of an N-body
  simulation.

* Various other potentials: ``PlummerPotential``, a standard Plummer
  potential; ``MN3ExponentialDiskPotential``, an approximation to an
  exponential disk using three Miyamoto-Nagai potentials (`Smith et
  al. 2015 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.448.2934S>`__);
  ``KuzminKutuzovStaeckelPotential``, a Staeckel potential that can be
  used to approximate the potential of a disk galaxy (`Batsleer &
  Dejonghe 1994
  <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994A%26A...287...43B>`__).
