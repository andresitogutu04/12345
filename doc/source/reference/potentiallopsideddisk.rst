Lopsided disk potential
============================

Like in `Kuijken & Tremaine <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994ApJ...421..178K>`_, but for m=1. See :ref:`galpy.potential.CosmphiDiskPotential <cosmphidisk>` for a more general version that allows for a break radius within which the radial dependence of the potential changes from R^p to R^-p (lopsided disk corresponds to ``m=1``).
